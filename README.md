# Introduction
This is my solution for the Coding challenge of Insight Data Engineering. The challenge can be found at: https://github.com/InsightDataScience/find-political-donors

# Approach

The input file `itcont.txt` lists campaign contributions by individual donors. Weâ€™re primarily interested in the zip code associated with the donor, amount contributed, date of the transaction and ID of the recipient. Results were wrote to 2 output files: `medianvals_by_zip.txt` and `medianvals_by_date.txt`.

1. Input file was read line by line
2. Two dictionaries stored the data aggregated by id combines zip code and id combines date
3. Write to medianvals_by_zip.txt dynamically for every valid input line
4. After the entire input file is processed, the results data were sorted and wrote to medianvals_by_date.txt

## Details of input and output files

The Federal Election Commission provides data files stretching back years and is [regularly updated](http://classic.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml)

We are considering the following fields:  

* `CMTE_ID`: identifies the flier, which for our purposes is the recipient of this contribution
* `ZIP_CODE`:  zip code of the contributor (we only want the first five digits/characters)
* `TRANSACTION_DT`: date of the transaction
* `TRANSACTION_AMT`: amount of the transaction
* `OTHER_ID`: a field that denotes whether contribution came from a person or an entity 

Each line of the first output file `medianvals_by_zip.txt`:
* recipient of the contribution  
* 5-digit zip code of the contributor  
* running median of contributions received by recipient from the contributor's zip code streamed in so far.  
* counts of the contributions from same contributions with the same zip code
* total amount of contributions received by recipient from the contributor's zip code streamed in so far

For example: `C00177436|30004|384|1|384`
 

Each line of the second output file `medianvals_by_date.txt`: 
* recipeint of the contribution 
* date of the contribution  
* median of contributions received by recipient on that date.  to the next dollar) 
* total number of transactions received by recipient on that date
* total amount of contributions received by recipient on that date

For example: `C00177436|01312017|384|4|13823`

Unlike the first output file, this second output file should have lines sorted alphabetical by recipient and then chronologically by date.

# Packages required
* datetime
* time
* sys
* statistics

# Run Instructions
To run this program, simply execute the `./run.sh` in the root directory.
To run the tests, `insight_testsuite~$ ./run_tests.sh`


# Details of the tests
* Test_1: Test case provided by Insight Data Engineering.
* Test_2: Based on test_1, adding some repeat lines
* Test_3: Based on test_1, testing invalid zip code cases, invalid date cases, invalid other non-important fileds cases
* Test_4: It contains the first 50000 lines from the Federal Election Commission 2017-2018 individual contribution file downloaded from [Federal Election Commission](http://classic.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml#a2017_2018),
